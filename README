NAME
    Template::Plugin::Clickable::Email - Make email addresses in to HTML
    links

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
      [% USE link_emails = Clickable::Email %]

    Then

      [% text | $link_emails %]

    or

      [% FILTER $link_emails %]
      <p>Some text that contains an address: nik@FreeBSD.org.</p>
      [% END %]

DESCRIPTION
    Template::Plugin::Clickable::Email converts any e-mail addresses found
    in the filtered text in to HTML "mailto:" links.

    This module uses Email::Find, see the documentation for that module for
    caveats relating to how addresses are parsed, and why some false
    positives may occur.
